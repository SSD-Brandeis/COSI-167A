        <h2><u>Late Policy</u></h2>
        <p>The late policy stated below is only applicable for paper reviews and technical questions, and NOT for paper presentations, project presentations, project evaluations (mid-term and final), and code review. Every student is granted a cumulative allowance of 4 late days, serving as extensions for their individual assignments, and no penalties are incurred during this period. These late days can be utilized across various assignments. However, once the allotment of 4 late days is exhausted, a penalty of 20% per day is imposed on overdue paper reviews and technical questions.</p>

        <h2><u>Contact Policy</u></h2>
        <p>The class website is updated in real-time with the class. This is your go-to for any general resources about the class. This is also where all project details will be posted, along with other relevant resources for the class. <br>
        
        Students are highly encouraged to regularly interact with the teaching staff to clarify doubts, ask questions, seek help for presentation review, and discuss project progress. Frequent interaction with the teaching staff is crucial to success in the course. <br>
        
        Emails sent during weekdays should expect a response within 48 hours. Be aware that not receiving a response is not a valid reason not to hand in homework/assignments on time, so start your work early to make sure you have no questions.

        <h2><u>Accommodations</u></h2>
        <p><b>Brandeis seeks to create a learning environment that is welcoming and inclusive of all students, and I want to support you in your learning. If you think you may require disability accommodations, you will need to work with Student Accessibility Support (SAS). You can contact them at 781-736-3470, email them at [access@brandeis.edu](mailto:access@brandeis.edu), or visit the <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/index.html" target="_blank">Student Accessibility Support home page</a>. You can find helpful student FAQs and other resources on the SAS website, including guidance on how to know whether you might be eligible for support from SAS. <br>
        
        If you already have an accommodation letter from SAS, please provide me with a copy as soon as you can so that I can ensure effective implementation of accommodations for this class. In order to coordinate exam accommodations, ideally you should provide the accommodation letter at least 48 hours before an exam.</b>
