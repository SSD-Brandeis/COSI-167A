        <h2><u>Late Policy</u></h2>
        <p>Every student is granted a cumulative allowance of 4 late days, serving as extensions for their individual assignments, and no penalties are incurred during this period. These late days can be utilized across various assignments. However, once the allotment of 4 late days is exhausted, a penalty of 20% per day is imposed on overdue homework assignments.</p>

        <h2><u>Contact Policy</u></h2>
        <p>LATTE/Piazza will be the preferred mode of communication with the instructor and teaching assistants (TAs) outside of class hours and student hours. Posts in Latte/Piazza will be responded to within 24 hours. Emails sent during weekdays should expect a response within 48 hours. Be aware that not receiving a response is not a valid reason to not hand in homework on time, so start your work early to make sure you have no questions. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to ask conceptual questions and start discussions through LATTE. Other students should feel free to answer any questions and participate in any discussions on LATTE. The instruction team will go through LATTE questions the same day that student hours are held.</p>

        <h2><u>Accommodations</u></h2>
        <p><b>Brandeis seeks to create a learning environment that is welcoming and inclusive of all students, and I want to support you in your learning. If you think you may require disability accommodations, you will need to work with Student Accessibility Support (SAS). You can contact them at 781-736-3470, email them at [access@brandeis.edu](mailto:access@brandeis.edu), or visit the <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/accessibility/index.html" target="_blank">Student Accessibility Support home page</a>. You can find helpful student FAQs and other resources on the SAS website, including guidance on how to know whether you might be eligible for support from SAS.</b></p>

By minimizing the use of laptops and mobile devices, we aim to enhance the overall quality of the learning experience and encourage direct interaction with course materials and fellow students.
